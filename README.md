# Coding Exercises

Here is a collection of coding exercises,  along with tests for them. 

The exercises are in the exercises directory. Each file has its own problem to solve. Make each file's exported run function return the output expected by the tests, as described in each file's comment.

To run the tests, and check your work, execute the following command in a terminal in the same directory as this readme file.
```
npm run test
```
